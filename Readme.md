Created an exercise app.
Created three components - ExerciseCard, LogEntry, Timer
ExerciseCard handles images and the switch
LogEntry handles data entry
Timer is self explanatory
Three components utilized in three screens - BenchPress, Deadlift, Squat
Pretty straightforward what those do
Created a home screen to easily navigate between the three as well as a bottom-row of tabs

User begins at home screen. Can select what exercise they want to do (Bottom tabs are suggested order). user can run a timer for their rests. User can also log their weight and reps.

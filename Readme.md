Created an exercise app.
The exercise app has three main components - ExerciseCard, LogEntry, Timer
ExerciseCard handles images and the switch functions, LogEntry handles data entry to track workotus, Timer allows the user to time their rests or workouts. 
These components are utilized in three basic workout screens, all linked by 'home' - Deadlifts, Squats, and Bench Press. 
Each workout has an alternative movement for accessiblity. 
Created a home screen to easily navigate between the three as well as a bottom-row of tabs
User begins at home screen. Can select what exercise they want to do (Bottom tabs are suggested order). user can run a timer for their rests. User can also log their weight and reps.
